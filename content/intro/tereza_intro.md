#Action to Surface
# How does performativity affect the surface?
# by Tereza Rullerova

## Due to my previous artistic experience I understand using a body and an action as designers methods. Despite the terms action and surface exist in seemingly disconnected worlds, I see the possibility to establish the connection and elaborate more on multidisciplinary link between -and coexistence of- performativity and graphic design. ##

## Following thesis introduces the research question: How does performativity affect the surface? Encouraged to answer this question, I examine the field of performance art, graphic design craftsmanship and vernacular action. As a result I demonstrate several examples the performativity is represented in contemporary post-digital culture and how it determines the production of its surface. ##

## We are used to present the graphic design as surface-centric praxis, surface-production tool and a strategy. In contradiction to that I try to step out of separated media constrains and through philosophy of affects (and affordances) I tend to establish new field of potential. ##

## This research covers the investigation and establishment of linking between action, body, designer and surface. It attempts to convince the reader, that design process is a kind of action, whereas we (designers) are responsible to be conscious about that fact. The text is a manifestation of emerging designer, his/her milieu and effort to position himself/herself into the world of democratized surface production. ##
