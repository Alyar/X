Despite the terms action and surface exist in seemingly disconnected worlds, I see the possibility to establish the connection and elaborate more on multidisciplinary link between -and coexistence of- performativity and graphic design.</h2>

Encouraged to answer this question, I examine the field of performance art, graphic design craftsmanship and vernacular action. As a result I demonstrate several examples the performativity is represented in contemporary post-digital culture and how it determines the production of its surface.</h2>

In contradiction to that I try to step out of separated media constrains and through philosophy of affects (and affordances) I tend to establish new field of potential.</h2>

It attempts to convince the reader, that design process is a kind of action, whereas we (designers) are responsible to be conscious about that fact. The text is a manifestation of emerging designer, his/her milieu and effort to position himself/herself into the world of democratized surface production.</h2>
