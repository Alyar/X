Today the graphic design practice has become increasingly dispersed in it’s definition, and in it’s role. Where we often question the value, craft, and function of design as a tool by which we shape our environments, languages, and realities with.</h2>

Resulting from the technological developments which have largely democratized the tools of design, while also offering a broad scope of platforms for design work to exist in. For a climate where the designer has assumed himself as author, artist, researcher, curator, and producer; in the interest of superseding the marginalization of the craft, and it’s value.</h2>
