				<p> Body text This thesis investigates the reductive effects of the digital paradigm on our collective cultural evolution. It identifies ways that graphic design can engage the public in dialogue about its technology, reestablish a critical examination of its own practices, and provide an environment of rich and progressive cultural participation. “Burn Your Loot” means freeing yourself from common practice and consumption and fostering new ideas for the here and now.</p>
