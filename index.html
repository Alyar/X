Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        	 <h1 id="TitleAction">Action to Surface: How does performativity affect production of surface?</h1>
<h2 id="chapter00">Abstract</h2>

<p>As a communication designer, I am interested in my role in -and possible valuable contribution to- society. With the idea that graphic design is a 'tool' for me, and during the creative process desiger is able to become tool himself as well, I see the possibility to communicate and elaborate more on this multidisciplinary link between -and coexistence of- performativity and graphic design.

I began with the reasearch question: How does performativity affect production of surface? and to answer this question, I compel to explore the field of performance and performativity before I bring it through philosophy of affects (and affordances) in connection with production of surface.

In this thesis you will withness investigation and establishment of my new term, a bold statement which derived a concept of “Action to Surface”. It is a manifestation of emerging designer, critical and self-reflective work of positioning myslef into the world of graphic design.</p>

<h2 id="chapter01">keywords</h2>
<p>action, acting, performance, performativity, surface, affect, attention, tool, craft, production, process, originality, subjectivity, post-digital, becoming, relation, audience, viewer</p>

<h2 id="chapter02">Dealing with the Terms</h1>
<p>PERFORMATIVITY</p>

<p>There are few terms to discuss and distinguish: Performance, Performativity and Performative. Which of those terms contains in its creator; designer? Which one includes the process of designing and which one the result? Is there something like design ecology? (Deleuze on ecology) How; and if then why; do designers use performativity? Do they perform and or do they act like that consciously?</p>

<p>SURFACE</p>

<p>In my research question I intend to aviod the word “design”, instead I use “surface”. Design is too wide term, therefore slippery. But surface is perfect term for art and design together and its also up-to date (Metahaven used it in their White Night Before a Manifesto). “We are designing surface. … Surface is folded out in order to produce value, while it is folded in to secure it. The production of surface is design’s equivalent to the production of space; surface in the generic sense means flat space to display. Surface is anorexic, hyper-thin architecture.” So I can use it too, but maybe more in terms of performativity.. and it's good to explain in begining what is the surface and how it affects designer and also viewer. What are the affordances of surface (affordance - by Brian Massumi, Andrew Murphie)</p>

<p>PRODUCTION</p>

<p>Production is fine term, it belongs to my research question, it work with Capitalism (I can read a bit from Ellen Lupton's text Designer as Producer, especially the part on Marxism, where is explained that production is the process from an idea from conception to finished product) and if there is more time, I can also expand the thesis by “reproduction” and “self-production” of surface (going deeper into media theory, focused on contemporary post-digital problematics). Baudrillard: modern societies are organized around the production and consumption of commodities. MARX: Capital begins with an analysis of the idea of commodity production.</p>

<p>AFFECT</p>
<p>A)verb = to have an influence on someone or something, or to cause a change in someone or something; B)noun Affect = is a concept used in the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza and elaborated by Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari that places emphasis on bodily experience. "affective turn"- ??</p>

<h2 id="chapter03">Action -to- object vs. Action -to- Surface -to- action</h2>
<p>Action to object is phenomenon well described in performance art history, it's particular shift from action with artist’s body - or in specific environment - to object or documentation which then becomes an object as well (60s - Fluxus and others) With the given shift, I would like to investigate how and if the designer's performance can move towards surface and if it leads back again (throgh affecting the audience or viewer). So to find a trace through the affect back to acting again! Object-driven vs experience-driven design, described in The Visual Event, book by Oliver Klimpel.</p>

<h2 id="chapter04">Production of knowledge</h2>
<p>As designers, as creators we are involved in the process of creating (not just adjusting) knowledge.. We are responsible. (this can be further investigated in essay Fuck the Content by M. Rock from Graphic Design: In Production) On top of that, production of knowledge relates to art, performance and craft. Art is knowledge-through-creation-of-object and performance is knowledge-throug-acting, craft is knowledge of potentials of materials: “Performance as a phenomenon enhances specific ability that art has to construct new knowledge formations and promote change through the apparatus of the “working-through”. Quote from the book PER / FORM - How to do things with /out/ words.</p>



<h1 id="title"> title essay </h1>
<h2 id="subtitelnaam">alyar001 </h1>
<p>Graphic design has always been a practice which has been hard to define, for both the outside world as well as to graphic designers themselves. While graphic design is an incredible broad and diverse discipline, it also continues to become more and more dispersed between different disciplines in the applied arts, and also changing in relation to technological developments and the implications that they bring.</p>

<p>While the means of production in graphic design have changed drastically throughout the years, the value of form has also changed with it. Which poses a question about the function, context, and future of form. While graphic design remains as a practice which is self-referntial in that it is a discipline which always refers to it’s own material body and context. Digital developments however have liberated from the discipline from that material frame. Graphic design is no longer marginalised by it’s physical limitations, hence a bigger responsibility for the possibilities towards the way we create and use form throughout the ethics in design and visual culture at large. In the interest of this issue, graphic design has also been a practice which constantly re-examines itself, and reshapes itself based on cultural needs, trends, and technological developments.

This also implies a range of possibilities for graphic designers. It now means that we are in charge of all aspects of production, in which we have become our own authors, producers, art directors, curators, editors, and designers. As the focus on printed matter has been largely in interference with the web and technological developments, it addresses fundamental changes in the practice which lay a much bigger emphasis on screen and web design than ever before. With that, the context of the work, the form, is quick to change. We are designing for different podia’s with form being it’s biggest change and asset.</p> 

<h2 id="subtitelnaam02">alyar002</h2>
<p>But what does this mean for form? “Everyone As Author” is a term that we’ve come to learn well. But what does this imply exactly? It suggests that in the age of digitalisation, there is a fundamental change in the dynamics of how graphic design is created and how it is outputted to the world and perceived, used, and multiplied by others. Due to the fact that today with the web and the available reach for graphic design, it finds itself across any given context but it’s own as is quick to become ephemeral matter. In that, there is also a responsibility of treating form to that of it’s intended context</p>

<p>What is it as a practice? what does it offer, and how does it adapt itself to new mediums, contexts and processes. For example, when it expands into a new system based on the criteria and the rules of that particular system (The web for example) the form is changes through a different set of intended results, techniques, and motives. Visual languages are constantly changing. Which also means that our environments change too. By designing, recreating, repeating, experimenting and publishing our ideas, thoughts, and opinions, we are changing the way reality is constructed through form. Which ultimately poses the question of — How are we defining language through form? And How are we giving shape to our environments and our reality?

So what is the value of form in our time? How does form motivate new questions about aesthetics and their implications? And lastly, what is the relation between form and reality?</p>
