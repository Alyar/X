						<p>by Tereza Rullerova</p>
					</div>

					<div class="intro_text">
						

						<p>Due to my previous artistic experience I understand using a body and an action as designers methods. Despite the terms action and surface exist in seemingly disconnected worlds, I see the possibility to establish the connection and elaborate more on multidisciplinary link between -and coexistence of- performativity and graphic design.</p>

						<p>Following thesis introduces the research question: How does performativity affect the surface? Encouraged to answer this question, I examine the field of performance art, graphic design craftsmanship and vernacular action. As a result I demonstrate several examples the performativity is represented in contemporary post-digital culture and how it determines the production of its surface. </p>
