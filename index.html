            <h1>The Value of Form</h1>

            <h3><i>by</i> Alyar Aynetchi</h3>
            <h2>How Can We Reclaim A Balance Between Form And Content?</h2>

            <div class="stripcontent">
                <p><em>Graphic design</em> has evolved throughout history as an artistic and communicative discipline which has
                    originated through the practice and development of visual forms. While <em>graphic design</em> is a
                    discipline which is inherently driven by an analytical process towards the development and
                    organisation of content, forms, and visual syntax; in recent years it has been argued that the
                    origination of content favours a higher value than that of shaping it. And in this respect, graphic
                    design has been predominantly redefined as a discipline which is bound to a research driven agenda,
                    or ‘think tank’. Whereby the primary emphasis of practice points to the development of content, and
                    the linguistic components therein; rather than employing the <em>craft</em> of shaping content.
                </p>

                <p> Additionally, the arena of contemporary <em>graphic design</em> has expanded considerably beyond it’s
                    conventional borders into a fully-fledged climate of multidisciplinary <em>design</em>. And in turn, <em>graphic
                    design</em> has become increasingly affiliated with processes and frameworks coinciding with other
                    artistic disciplines, and intellectual motives alike. However, while the expansion of <em>graphic design</em>
                    has supplemented its development on a wider spectrum: from research, to production tools, to the
                    greater social context; graphic design has in turn become more and more dispersed in it’s
                    definition. And in this process, the social status of <em>graphic design</em> has been reformed from a
                    ‘practice based on the development of forms’, to ‘a practice based on the development of content’.
                </p>

                <p> This reform may suggest a new standard which values content over form. And while content, analysis,
                    and research are an integral part of a design process; form is one of the most fundamental aspects
                    of <em>graphic design</em> as a discipline. And hence, this poses a responsibility in how we shape our surroundings.
                    Through the languages, systems, and forms which we establish. Through the self revising
                    nature of the practice, and the critical re-assessment of these developments; <em>graphic design</em> has
                    revised itself time and time again based on sociocultural, political, and economical circumstances.
                </p>

                <p> The following thesis aims to stimulate a discussion around the value of form in contemporary <em>graphic
                    design</em>. And the ways in which the field has been redefined. How do we reclaim a balance between form
                    and content? How do we continue to shape our surroundings through current frameworks in <em>graphic
                    design</em>? And how do we pose greater questions towards the development of new visual forms? And how
                    do we validate the value of form, craft, and practice in a highly sporadic stage in <em>graphic design</em>
                    discourse.

            <h3><i>by</i> Mike Kokken</h3>

            <h2>How do I handle the destructive consequences of the 'why' question in my work process?</h2>



            <div class="stripcontent">
                <p>Asking questions continuously seems inherent to and necessary for art and <em>graphic design’s</em> existence
                    and survival. A question can hereby follow two directions - construction (ever building on a
                    foundation) or destruction (tearing down until there’s anything left). While men mostly thinks and
                    executes constructive, I feel more inclined towards destruction. But not without trouble. Once I’ve
                    started taking down, I have <em>difficulty</em> stopping and will eventually get stuck in the process.
                    Because I am convinced destruction can play an important role in the question and it’s result, I
                    would like to inspect it further. 
                </p>

                <p> I hope to get a better grip personally on how asking those
                    necessary questions go “wrong” but also how it can be applied in for others in a time where
                    changeability and uncertainty prevail. Firstly, the frame will be treated to comprehend how our
                    <em>view</em> on the world is shaped and works - the fundamentals on which destruction can strike. This will
                    be followed by the different stages <em>destruction</em> consists of: the *Strike*, the *Explosion* and the
                    *Implosion*, the *Downfall*, the *Dust Cloud* and the *Ruins*. I come to see that the plausible
                    construction works falsely and destruction is rather necessary to ask the right questions and be
                    future-oriented.

            <h1>Action to Surface</h1>
            <h3><i>by</i> Tereza Rullerova</h3>

            <h2>How does performativity influence the surface?</h2>



            <div class="stripcontent">

                <p>Due to my previous artistic experience I understand using the body and an action as a method of
                    <em>design</em>. Despite the fact that the terms action and <em>surface</em> exist in seemingly  disconnected worlds,
                    I see the possibility to establish a connection and elaborate more on a multidisciplinary link
                    between – and coexistence of – performativity and <em>graphic design</em>.
                </p>

                <p> The following thesis introduces the research question: How does performativity influence the
                    surface? Encouraged to answer this question, I examine the field of performance art, <em>graphic design</em>
                    craftsmanship and vernacular action. As a result I demonstrate several examples of performative acts
                    in contemporary graphic design related visual culture and how it determines the production of its
                    surface.
                </p>

                <p> We, designers, are used to presenting <em>graphic design</em> as a surface-centric practice, the way of
                    surface production. In addition to this, I try to step out of separated media constrains and tend to
                    establish a new field of potential through identifying <em>performative</em> components in graphic design
                    processes and results.
                </p>

                <p> This research covers the investigation and establishment of links between action, body, <em>designer</em> and
                    surface. It attempts to convince the reader, that surface production could be an action, happening,
                    or chance-‑driven act. Therefore the text introduces necessary theoretical, philosophical and
                    historical backgrounds of performance art.
                </p>

                <p> The narrative covers examples from Leonardo da Vinci through Modernists, Post-‑War Expressionists
                    and Andy Warhol to recent work by Hito Steyerl. It also presents <em>graphic designers</em> working with
                    action in their design process. For example Sister Corita Kent’s activism, Stefan Sagmeister with
                    his involvement of the body and nomadism, the conceptual approach of Czech designer Petr Babák, Maki
                    Suzuki with his excitement “to do”, ephemeral surfaces and the unforgettable events of Cox and
                    Grusenmeyer, Moniker with their Conditional Design happenings towards surface and Auto
                    Italia’s identity of interactive assistant.
                </p>

                <p> Finally, the text explains why the contemporary form of <em>labour</em> - Sven Lütticken’s concept of general
                    performance - is so important. This thesis is a manifestation of the emerging designer, his/her
                    milieu and effort to position himself/herself into the world of democratized surface production.
